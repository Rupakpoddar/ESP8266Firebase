# ⚠️ Deprecated Arduino Library

**This library is no longer maintained and has been officially deprecated.**

### Replacement Library

We highly recommend transitioning to the new and improved Firebase Arduino library, which supports ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, and offers more reliability and enhanced functionality. The new library is also fully compatible with the Arduino Cloud IDE.

- **GitHub Repository:** [Firebase Arduino](https://github.com/Rupakpoddar/FirebaseArduino)
- **Arduino Reference:** [Firebase Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/firebase/)

Please update your projects to use the new library to benefit from the latest features and improvements.
